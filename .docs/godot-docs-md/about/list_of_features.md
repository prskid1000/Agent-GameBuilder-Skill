## List of features

This page aims to list **all** features currently supported by Godot.

> **Note:** This page lists features supported by the current stable version of Godot. Some of these features are not available in the `3.x release series <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.6/about/list_of_features.html>`__.
### Platforms

.. seealso::

    See [doc_system_requirements](system_requirements.md#doc_system_requirements) for hardware and software version requirements.

> **Note:** For information about console support, see the `Godot website <https://godotengine.org/consoles/>`_.
**Can run both the editor and exported projects:**

- Windows (x86 and ARM, 64-bit and 32-bit).
- macOS (x86 and ARM, 64-bit only).
- Linux (x86 and ARM, 64-bit and 32-bit).

   - Binaries are statically linked and can run on any distribution if compiled
     on an old enough base distribution.
   - Official binaries are compiled using the
     Godot Engine buildroot,
     allowing for binaries that work across common Linux distributions.

- Android (editor support is experimental).
- [Web browsers](../tutorials/editor/using_the_web_editor.md#doc_using_the_web_editor). Experimental in 4.0,
  using Godot 3.x is recommended instead when targeting HTML5.

> **Note:** Linux supports rv64 (RISC-V), ppc64 & ppc32 (PowerPC), and loongarch64. However you must compile the editor for that platform (as well as export templates) yourself, no official downloads are currently provided. RISC-V compiling instructions can be found on the :ref:`doc_compiling_for_linuxbsd` page.
**Runs exported projects:**

- iOS.

Godot aims to be as platform-independent as possible and can be
[ported to new platforms](../engine_details/engine_api/custom_platform_ports.md#doc_custom_platform_ports) with relative ease.

> **Note:** Projects written in C# using Godot 4 currently cannot be exported to the web platform. To use C# on that platform, consider Godot 3 instead. Android and iOS platform support is available as of Godot 4.2, but is experimental and :ref:`some limitations apply <doc_c_sharp_platforms>`.

  in the Project Manager and import them directly.

### Rendering

Godot 4 includes three renderers:

- **Forward+**. The most advanced renderer, suited for desktop platforms only.
  Used by default on desktop platforms. This renderer uses **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**,
  or **Metal** as the rendering driver, and it uses the **RenderingDevice** backend.
- **Mobile**. Fewer features, but renders simple scenes faster. Suited for mobile
  and desktop platforms. Used by default on mobile platforms. This renderer uses
  **Vulkan**, **Direct3D 12**, or **Metal** as the rendering driver, and it uses
  the **RenderingDevice** backend.
- **Compatibility**, sometimes called **GL Compatibility**. The least advanced
  renderer, suited for low-end desktop and mobile platforms. Used by default on
  the web platform. This renderer uses **OpenGL** as the rendering driver.

See [doc_renderers](../tutorials/rendering/renderers.md#doc_renderers) for a detailed comparison of the rendering methods.

### 2D graphics

- Sprite, polygon and line rendering.

   - High-level tools to draw lines and polygons such as

  - 3D particle collision shapes supported: box, sphere, baked signed distance field
    and real-time heightmap (suited for open world weather effects).
  - 2D particle collision is handled using a signed distance field generated in real-time
    based on [class_LightOccluder2D](../classes/class_lightoccluder2d.md#class_LightOccluder2D) nodes in the scene.

**Resolution scaling:**

- Support for [rendering 3D at a lower resolution](../tutorials/3d/resolution_scaling.md#doc_resolution_scaling)
  while keeping 2D rendering at the original scale. This can be used to improve
  performance on low-end systems or improve visuals on high-end systems.
- Resolution scaling uses bilinear filtering, AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution
  1.0 (FSR1) or AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 2.2 (FSR2).
- Texture mipmap LOD bias is adjusted automatically to improve quality at lower
  resolution scales. It can also be modified with a manual offset.

Most effects listed above can be adjusted for better performance or to further
improve quality. This can be helpful when
[using Godot for offline rendering](../tutorials/animation/creating_movies.md#doc_creating_movies).

     but can optionally use exclusive fullscreen to reduce input lag.

- Borderless windows (fullscreen or non-fullscreen).
- Keep a window always on top.
- Make a window ignore focus (useful for overlays).
- Declare a window as a popup (hidden from task switcher)
  or exclusive (prevents interacting with other windows from the same process).
- Native file dialog support on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.
- Tray icon support on Windows and macOS.
- Global menu integration on macOS.
- Client-side decorations on macOS.
- Execute commands in a blocking or non-blocking manner (including running
  multiple instances of the same project).
- Open file paths and URLs using default or custom protocol handlers (if registered on the system).
- Parse custom command line arguments.
- Support for screen readers on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Any Godot binary (editor or exported project) can be
  [used as a headless server](../tutorials/export/exporting_for_dedicated_servers.md#doc_exporting_for_dedicated_servers)
  by starting it with the `--headless` command line argument.
  This allows running the engine without a GPU or display server.

### XR support (AR and VR)

- Out of the box [support for OpenXR](../tutorials/xr/setting_up_xr.md#doc_setting_up_xr).

   - Including support for popular desktop headsets like the Valve Index, WMR headsets, and Quest over Link.

- Support for [Android-based headsets](../tutorials/xr/deploying_to_android.md#doc_deploying_to_android) using OpenXR through a plugin.

  - Including support for popular stand alone headsets like the Meta Quest 1/2/3 and Pro, Pico 4, Magic Leap 2, and Lynx R1.

- Out of the box limited support for visionOS Apple headsets.

  - Currently only exporting an application for use on a flat plane within the
    headset is supported. Immersive experiences are not supported.

- Other devices supported through an XR plugin structure.
- Various advanced toolkits are available that implement common features required by XR applications.

### GUI system

Godot's GUI is built using the same Control nodes used to make games in Godot.
The editor UI can easily be extended in many ways using add-ons.

**Nodes:**

- Buttons.
- Checkboxes, check buttons, radio buttons.
- Text entry using [class_LineEdit](../classes/class_lineedit.md#class_LineEdit) (single line) and [class_TextEdit](../classes/class_textedit.md#class_TextEdit) (multiple lines).
  TextEdit also supports code editing features such as displaying line numbers
  and syntax highlighting.
- Dropdown menus using [class_PopupMenu](../classes/class_popupmenu.md#class_PopupMenu) and [class_OptionButton](../classes/class_optionbutton.md#class_OptionButton).
- Scrollbars.
- Labels.
- RichTextLabel for [text formatted using BBCode](../tutorials/ui/bbcode_in_richtextlabel.md#doc_bbcode_in_richtextlabel),
  with support for animated custom effects.
- Trees (can also be used to represent tables).
- Color picker with RGB and HSV modes.
- Controls can be rotated and scaled.

**Sizing:**

- Anchors to keep GUI elements in a specific corner, edge or centered.
- Containers to place GUI elements automatically following certain rules.

   - [Stack](../classes/class_boxcontainer.md#class_BoxContainer) layouts.
   - [Grid](../classes/class_gridcontainer.md#class_GridContainer) layouts.
   - [Flow](../classes/class_flowcontainer.md#class_FlowContainer) layouts (similar to autowrapping text).
   - [Margin](../classes/class_margincontainer.md#class_MarginContainer), [centered](../classes/class_centercontainer.md#class_CenterContainer)
     and [aspect ratio](../classes/class_aspectratiocontainer.md#class_AspectRatioContainer) layouts.
   - [Draggable splitter](../classes/class_splitcontainer.md#class_SplitContainer) layouts.

- Scale to [multiple resolutions](../tutorials/rendering/multiple_resolutions.md#doc_multiple_resolutions) using the
  `canvas_items` or `viewport` stretch modes.
- Support any aspect ratio using anchors and the `expand` stretch aspect.

**Theming:**

- Built-in theme editor.

   - Generate a theme based on the current editor theme settings.

- Procedural vector-based theming using [class_StyleBoxFlat](../classes/class_styleboxflat.md#class_StyleBoxFlat).

   - Supports rounded/beveled corners, drop shadows, per-border widths and antialiasing.

- Texture-based theming using [class_StyleBoxTexture](../classes/class_styleboxtexture.md#class_StyleBoxTexture).

Godot's small distribution size can make it a suitable alternative to frameworks
like Electron or Qt.

### Animation

- Direct kinematics and inverse kinematics.
- Support for animating any property with customizable interpolation.
- Support for calling methods in animation tracks.
- Support for playing sounds in animation tracks.
- Support for Bézier curves in animation.

### File formats

- Scenes and resources can be saved in [text-based](../engine_details/file_formats/tscn.md#doc_tscn_file_format) or binary formats.

   - Text-based formats are human-readable and more friendly to version control.
   - Binary formats are faster to save/load for large scenes/resources.

- Read and write text or binary files using [class_FileAccess](../classes/class_fileaccess.md#class_FileAccess).

   - Can optionally be compressed or encrypted.

- Read and write [class_JSON](../classes/class_json.md#class_JSON) files.
- Read and write INI-style configuration files using [class_ConfigFile](../classes/class_configfile.md#class_ConfigFile).

   - Can (de)serialize any Godot datatype, including Vector2/3, Color, ...

- Read XML files using [class_XMLParser](../classes/class_xmlparser.md#class_XMLParser).
- [Load and save images, audio/video, fonts and ZIP archives](../tutorials/io/runtime_file_loading_and_saving.md#doc_runtime_loading_and_saving)
  in an exported project without having to go through Godot's import system.
- Pack game data into a PCK file (custom format optimized for fast seeking),
  into a ZIP archive, or directly into the executable for single-file distribution.
- [Export additional PCK files](../tutorials/export/exporting_pcks.md#doc_exporting_pcks) that can be read
  by the engine to support mods and DLCs.

### Miscellaneous

- [Video playback](../tutorials/animation/playing_videos.md#doc_playing_videos) with built-in support for Ogg Theora.
- [Movie Maker mode](../tutorials/animation/creating_movies.md#doc_creating_movies) to record videos from a running
  project with synchronized audio and perfect frame pacing.
- [Low-level access to servers](../tutorials/performance/using_servers.md#doc_using_servers) which allows bypassing
  the scene tree's overhead when needed.
- [Command line interface](../tutorials/editor/command_line_tutorial.md#doc_command_line_tutorial) for automation.

   - Export and deploy projects using continuous integration platforms.
   - Shell completion scripts
     are available for Bash, zsh and fish.
   - Print colored text to standard output on all platforms using
     print_rich.

- The editor can
  [detect features used in a project and create a compilation profile](../tutorials/editor/using_engine_compilation_configuration_editor.md#doc_engine_compilation_configuration_editor),
  which can be used to create smaller export template binaries
  with unneeded features disabled.
- Support for [C++ modules](../engine_details/engine_api/custom_modules_in_cpp.md#doc_custom_modules_in_cpp) statically linked
  into the engine binary.

  - Most built-in modules can be disabled at compile-time to reduce binary size
    in custom builds. See [doc_optimizing_for_size](../engine_details/development/compiling/optimizing_for_size.md#doc_optimizing_for_size) for details.

- Engine and editor written in C++17.

   - Can be [compiled](../engine_details/development/compiling/introduction_to_the_buildsystem.md#doc_introduction_to_the_buildsystem) using GCC,
     Clang and MSVC. MinGW is also supported.
   - Friendly towards packagers. In most cases, system libraries can be used
     instead of the ones provided by Godot. The build system doesn't download anything.
     Builds can be fully reproducible.

- Licensed under the permissive MIT license.

   - Open development process with contributions welcome.
