## Configuring an IDE

We assume that you have already cloned
and compiled Godot.

You can easily develop Godot with any text editor and by invoking `scons`
on the command line, but if you want to work with an IDE (Integrated
Development Environment), here are setup instructions for some popular ones:

- [Android Studio](android_studio.md)
- [Clion](clion.md)
- [Code Blocks](code_blocks.md)
- [Kdevelop](kdevelop.md)
- [Qt Creator](qt_creator.md)
- [Rider](rider.md)
- [Visual Studio](visual_studio.md)
- [Visual Studio Code](visual_studio_code.md)
- [Xcode](xcode.md)
- [It Is Possible To Use Other Ides, But Their Setup Is Not Documented Yet.](It is possible to use other IDEs, but their setup is not documented yet..md)
- [If Your Editor Supports The `Language Server Protocol <Https://Microsoft.Github.Io/Language Server Protocol/>`  ,](If your editor supports the `language server protocol <https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/>`__,.md)
- [You Can Use `Clangd <Https://Clangd.Llvm.Org>`   For Completion, Diagnostics, And More.](you can use `clangd <https://clangd.llvm.org>`__ for completion, diagnostics, and more..md)
- [You Can Generate A Compilation Database For Use With Clangd One Of Two Ways:](You can generate a compilation database for use with clangd one of two ways:.md)
- [# Generate Compile Commands.Json While Compiling](# Generate compile_commands.json while compiling.md)
- [Scons Compiledb=Yes](scons compiledb=yes.md)
- [# Generate Compile Commands.Json Without Compiling](# Generate compile_commands.json without compiling.md)
- [Scons Compiledb=Yes Compile Commands.Json](scons compiledb=yes compile_commands.json.md)
