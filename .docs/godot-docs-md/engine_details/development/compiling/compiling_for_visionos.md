## Compiling for visionOS

.. seealso::

    This page describes how to compile visionOS export template binaries from source.
    If you're looking to export your project to visionOS instead, see [doc_exporting_for_visionos](../../../tutorials/export/exporting_for_visionos.md#doc_exporting_for_visionos).

Compiling instructions for visionOS are currently identical to
[doc_compiling_for_ios](compiling_for_ios.md#doc_compiling_for_ios), except you should replace instances of
`platform=ios` with `platform=visionos` in the SCons options.
See the linked page for details.
