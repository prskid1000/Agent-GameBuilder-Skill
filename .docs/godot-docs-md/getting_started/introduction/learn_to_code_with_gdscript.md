## Learn to code with GDScript

In Godot, you can write code using the GDScript and C# programming languages.

If you are new to programming, we recommend starting with GDScript because we
designed it to be simpler than all-purpose languages like C#. It will be both
faster and easier to learn.

While GDScript is a language specific to Godot, the techniques you will learn
with it will apply to other programming languages.

Note that it is completely normal for a programmer to learn and use multiple
languages. Programming languages have more similarities than differences, so
once you know one, you can learn another much faster.

### Learn in your browser with the GDScript app

To learn GDScript, you can use the app Learn GDScript From Zero. It is a
