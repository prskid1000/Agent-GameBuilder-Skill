## Godot Docs – *master* branch

> **Note:** Expand the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom of the sidebar to see the list.

> **Note:** <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable>`_ by community members on `Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot-docs>`_. Depending on the translation effort's completion level, you may find paragraphs or whole pages which are still in English. You can help the community by providing new translations or reviewing existing ones on Weblate. For the time being, localized translations are only available for the "stable" branch. You can still view the English documentation for other engine versions using the "Read the Docs" panel at the bottom of the sidebar.
Welcome to the official documentation of Godot Engine,
the free and open source community-driven 2D and 3D game engine! If you are new
to this documentation, we recommend that you read the
[introduction page](about/introduction.md#doc_about_intro) to get an overview of what this
documentation has to offer.

To begin reading the relevant documentation, select the tile that matches your profile:


- **[I've never made a game before — I want to make a game.](about/introduction.md)**
- **[I know how to make a game — I want to know how to use Godot.](getting_started/step_by_step/index.md)**
- **[I know how to use Godot — I want to learn more advanced topics.](tutorials/index.md)**
- **I know Godot and want to contribute** (external: contributing.godotengine.org)

You can also use the table of contents in the sidebar to easily access
any section of the documentation for your topic of interest. You can
also use the search function in the top-left corner.

### Get involved

Godot Engine is an open source project developed by a community of volunteers.
