## Texture2DArray

**Inherits:** [ImageTextureLayered](class_imagetexturelayered.md#class_ImageTextureLayered) **<** [TextureLayered](class_texturelayered.md#class_TextureLayered) **<** [Texture](class_texture.md#class_Texture) **<** [Resource](class_resource.md#class_Resource) **<** [RefCounted](class_refcounted.md#class_RefCounted) **<** [Object](class_object.md#class_Object)

A single texture resource which consists of multiple, separate images. Each image has the same dimensions and number of mipmap levels.

### Description

A Texture2DArray is different from a Texture3D: The Texture2DArray does not support trilinear interpolation between the [Image](class_image.md#class_Image) s, i.e. no blending. See also [Cubemap](class_cubemap.md#class_Cubemap) and [CubemapArray](class_cubemaparray.md#class_CubemapArray), which are texture arrays with specialized cubemap functions.

A Texture2DArray is also different from an [AtlasTexture](class_atlastexture.md#class_AtlasTexture): In a Texture2DArray, all images are treated separately. In an atlas, the regions (i.e. the single images) can be of different sizes. Furthermore, you usually need to add a padding around the regions, to prevent accidental UV mapping to more than one region. The same goes for mipmapping: Mipmap chains are handled separately for each layer. In an atlas, the slicing has to be done manually in the fragment shader.

To create such a texture file yourself, reimport your image files using the Godot Editor import presets. To create a Texture2DArray from code, use [ImageTextureLayered.create_from_images()](class_imagetexturelayered.md#class_ImageTextureLayered_method_create_from_images) on an instance of the Texture2DArray class.
