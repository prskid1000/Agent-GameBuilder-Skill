## Performance

**Inherits:** [Object](class_object.md#class_Object)

Exposes performance-related data.

### Description

This class provides access to a number of different monitors related to performance, such as memory usage, draw calls, and FPS. These are the same as the values displayed in the **Monitor** tab in the editor's **Debugger** panel. By using the [get_monitor()](class_performance.md#class_Performance_method_get_monitor) method of this class, you can access this data from your code.

You can add custom monitors using the [add_custom_monitor()](class_performance.md#class_Performance_method_add_custom_monitor) method. Custom monitors are available in **Monitor** tab in the editor's **Debugger** panel together with built-in monitors.

 **Note:** Some of the built-in monitors are only available in debug mode and will always return `0` when used in a project exported in release mode.

 **Note:** Some of the built-in monitors are not updated in real-time for performance reasons, so there may be a delay of up to 1 second between changes.

 **Note:** Custom monitors do not support negative values. Negative values are clamped to 0.
