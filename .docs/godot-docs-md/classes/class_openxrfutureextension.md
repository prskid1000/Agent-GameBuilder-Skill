## OpenXRFutureExtension

**Inherits:** [OpenXRExtensionWrapper](class_openxrextensionwrapper.md#class_OpenXRExtensionWrapper) **<** [Object](class_object.md#class_Object)

The OpenXR Future extension allows for asynchronous APIs to be used.

### Description

This is a support extension in OpenXR that allows other OpenXR extensions to start asynchronous functions and get a callback after this function finishes. It is not intended for consumption within GDScript but can be accessed from GDExtension.

### Methods


| void | [cancel_future](class_openxrfutureextension.md#class_OpenXRFutureExtension_method_cancel_future) ( future: [int](class_int.md#class_int) ) |

### Method Descriptions

<span id="class_OpenXRFutureExtension_method_cancel_future"></span>

void **cancel_future** ( future: [int](class_int.md#class_int) ) [🔗](class_openxrfutureextension.md#class_OpenXRFutureExtension_method_cancel_future)

Cancels an in-progress future. `future` must be an `XrFutureEXT` value previously returned by an API that started an asynchronous function.

---

<span id="class_OpenXRFutureExtension_method_is_active"></span>

[bool](class_bool.md#class_bool) **is_active** ( ) *const* [🔗](class_openxrfutureextension.md#class_OpenXRFutureExtension_method_is_active)

Returns `true` if futures are available in the OpenXR runtime used. This function will only return a usable result after OpenXR has been initialized.

---

<span id="class_OpenXRFutureExtension_method_register_future"></span>

[OpenXRFutureResult](class_openxrfutureresult.md#class_OpenXRFutureResult) **register_future** ( future: [int](class_int.md#class_int), on_success: [Callable](class_callable.md#class_Callable) = Callable() ) [🔗](class_openxrfutureextension.md#class_OpenXRFutureExtension_method_register_future)

Register an OpenXR Future object so we monitor for completion. `future` must be an `XrFutureEXT` value previously returned by an API that started an asynchronous function.

You can optionally specify `on_success`, it will be invoked on successful completion of the future.

Or you can use the returned [OpenXRFutureResult](class_openxrfutureresult.md#class_OpenXRFutureResult) object to `await` its [OpenXRFutureResult.completed](class_openxrfutureresult.md#class_OpenXRFutureResult_signal_completed) signal.

::

    var future_result = OpenXRFutureExtension.register_future(future)
    await future_result.completed
    if future_result.get_status() == OpenXRFutureResult.RESULT_FINISHED:
        # Handle your success
        pass
