## ShaderGlobalsOverride

**Inherits:** [Node](class_node.md#class_Node) **<** [Object](class_object.md#class_Object)

A node used to override global shader parameters' values in a scene.

### Description

Similar to how a [WorldEnvironment](class_worldenvironment.md#class_WorldEnvironment) node can be used to override the environment while a specific scene is loaded, **ShaderGlobalsOverride** can be used to override global shader parameters temporarily. Once the node is removed, the project-wide values for the global shader parameters are restored. See the [RenderingServer](class_renderingserver.md#class_RenderingServer) `global_shader_parameter_*` methods for more information.

 **Note:** Only one **ShaderGlobalsOverride** can be used per scene. If there is more than one **ShaderGlobalsOverride** node in the scene tree, only the first node (in tree order) will be taken into account.

 **Note:** All **ShaderGlobalsOverride** nodes are made part of a `"shader_overrides_group"` group when they are added to the scene tree. The currently active **ShaderGlobalsOverride** node also has a `"shader_overrides_group_active"` group added to it. You can use this to check which **ShaderGlobalsOverride** node is currently active.
