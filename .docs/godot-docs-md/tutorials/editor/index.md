## Editor introduction

In this section, we cover the Godot editor in general, from its interface to
using it with the command line.

### Editor's interface

The following pages explain how to use the various windows, workspaces, and
docks that make up the Godot editor. We cover some specific editors' interfaces
in other sections where appropriate. For example, the :ref:`animation editor
<doc_introduction_animation>`.
