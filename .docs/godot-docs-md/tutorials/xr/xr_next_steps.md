## Where to go from here

Now that we have the basics covered there are several options to look at for your XR game dev journey:

* You can take a look at the Advanced topics section.
* You can look at a number of XR demos here.
* You can find 3rd party tutorials on our [Tutorials and resources](../../community/tutorials.md#doc_community_tutorials) page.

### Godot OpenXR vendor plugin

The vendor plugin isn't just for [deploying to Android](deploying_to_android.md#doc_deploying_to_android).
In the vendor plugin, we implement many OpenXR vendor extensions that unlock unique features on certain devices,
or features that are new enough that a standardized implementation is not available yet.

Together with the OpenXR working group we maintain a
client support matrix that lists
all the OpenXR extensions Godot supports and whether they require the vendor plugin.

### XR Toolkits

There are various XR toolkits available that implement more complex XR logic ready for you to use.
We have a :Ref:`small introduction to Godot XR Tools <godot-xr-tools>` that you can look at,
a toolkit developed by core contributors of Godot.

There are more toolkits available for Godot:

* Godot XR handtracking toolkit (GDScript)
* Godot XR Kit (GDScript)
* Godot XR Tools (GDScript)
* NXR (C#)
