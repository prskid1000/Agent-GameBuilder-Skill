## User interface (UI)

In this section of the tutorial, we explain the basics of creating a graphical
user interface (GUI) in Godot.

### UI building blocks

Like everything else in Godot, the user interface is built using nodes, specifically
[Control](../../classes/class_control.md#class_Control) nodes. There are many different types of controls
which are useful for creating specific types of GUIs. For simplicity, we can
separate them into two groups: content and layout.

Typical content controls include:

* [Buttons](../../classes/class_button.md#class_Button)
* [Labels](../../classes/class_label.md#class_Label)
* [LineEdits](../../classes/class_lineedit.md#class_LineEdit) and [TextEdits](../../classes/class_textedit.md#class_TextEdit)

Typical layout controls include:

* [BoxContainers](../../classes/class_boxcontainer.md#class_BoxContainer)
* [MarginContainers](../../classes/class_margincontainer.md#class_MarginContainer)
* [ScrollContainers](../../classes/class_scrollcontainer.md#class_ScrollContainer)
* [TabContainers](../../classes/class_tabcontainer.md#class_TabContainer)
* [Popups](../../classes/class_popup.md#class_Popup)
