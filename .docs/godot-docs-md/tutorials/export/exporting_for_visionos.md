## Exporting for visionOS

.. seealso::

    This page describes how to export a Godot project to visionOS.
    If you're looking to compile export template binaries from source instead,
    see [doc_compiling_for_visionos](../../engine_details/development/compiling/compiling_for_visionos.md#doc_compiling_for_visionos).

Exporting instructions for visionOS are currently identical to
[doc_compiling_for_ios](../../engine_details/development/compiling/compiling_for_ios.md#doc_compiling_for_ios), except you should add a **visionOS**
export preset instead of **iOS**. See the linked page for details.

> **Note:** Note that currently, only exporting an application for use on a flat plane within the headset is supported. Immersive experiences are not supported.
