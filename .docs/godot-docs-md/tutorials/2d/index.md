Godot includes a dedicated 2D renderer and 2D physics engine, as well as
2D-specific features like tilemaps, particles, and animation systems. This
section covers most 2D-specific topics in Godot.

For 2D topics not covered in this section, see also [doc_2d_skeletons](../animation/2d_skeletons.md#doc_2d_skeletons) and
[doc_navigation_overview_2d](../navigation/navigation_introduction_2d.md#doc_navigation_overview_2d). For using physics in 2D, see
[doc_physics_index](../physics/index.md#doc_physics_index). There is also a step-by-step tutorial on creating a 2D
game in [doc_your_first_2d_game](../../getting_started/first_2d_game/index.md#doc_your_first_2d_game).
