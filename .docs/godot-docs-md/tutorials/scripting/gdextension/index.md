## The GDExtension system

**GDExtension** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact with
native shared libraries
at runtime. You can use it to run native code without compiling it with the engine.

> **Note:** :ref:`GDScript <doc_gdscript>`.
This section describes how GDExtension works, and is generally aimed at people wanting to make a GDExtension from
scratch, for example to create language bindings. If you want to use existing language bindings, please refer to other
articles instead, such as the articles about [C++ (godot-cpp)](../cpp/index.md#doc_godot_cpp) or one of the
[community-made ones](../other_languages.md#doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings).
