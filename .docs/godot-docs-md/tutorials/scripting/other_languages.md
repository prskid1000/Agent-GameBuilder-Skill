### Other languages

The Godot developers officially support the following languages for Godot:

- [GDScript (all versions)](gdscript/index.md#doc_gdscript)
- [C# (.NET version)](c_sharp/index.md#doc_c_sharp)
- [C++ (via GDExtension)](cpp/index.md#doc_godot_cpp)

> **Note:** There are no plans to support additional languages officially. That said, the community offers several bindings for other languages (see below).

The bindings below are developed and maintained by the community:

.. Binding developers: Feel free to open a pull request to add your binding if it's well-developed enough to be used in a project.
.. Please keep languages sorted in alphabetical order.

- D
- Go
- Java/Kotlin
- Nim
- Rust
- Swift
- Odin

> **Note:** Not all bindings mentioned here may be production-ready. Make sure to research options thoroughly before starting a project with one of those. Also, double-check whether the binding is compatible with the Godot version you're using.
