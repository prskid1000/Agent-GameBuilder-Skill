## Quick start guide

- Turn on physics interpolation: Project Settings > Physics > Common > Physics Interpolation
- Make sure you move objects and run your game logic in `_physics_process()`
  rather than `_process()`. This includes moving objects directly *and
  indirectly* (by e.g. moving a parent, or using another mechanism to automatically
  move nodes).
- Be sure to call [Node.reset_physics_interpolation](../../../classes/class_node.md#class_Node_method_reset_physics_interpolation)
  on nodes *after* you first position or teleport them, to prevent "streaking".
- Temporarily try setting Project Settings > Physics > Common > Physics Ticks per Second
  to 10 to see the difference with and without interpolation.
